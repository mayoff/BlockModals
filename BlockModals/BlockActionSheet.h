## `BlockActionSheet`

Use me to offer the user a small selection of actions.  I am a subclass of `UIActionSheet`, and support all of the features of `UIActionSheet`.  I add support for setting handler blocks for each button.  You can set block for each button, for each phase of button handling.

The first phase is `BlockActionSheetClickedPhase`, which is when I send `actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:` to my delegate.  If you set a block for a button for this phase, and the user taps the button, then I invoke the block **instead of** sending `actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:` to my delegate.

The second phase is `BlockActionSheetDidDismissPhase`, which is when I send `actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex:` to my delegate.  If you set a block for a button for this phase, and the user taps the button, then I invoke the block **instead of** sending `actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex:` to my delegate.

If the user taps a button, and I don't have a block set for that button for some phase, then during that phase, I send the appropriate message to my delegate.

You can set my `delegate` if you want to respond to any other `UIActionSheetDelegate` messages, or if you want to respond to some buttons using the normal delegate methods.
